# Simple-line

As part of a submission, this little project contains a Python script that offers a possible solution approach as a proof of concept, alongside the Java project implementation as the final solution.

## Task

Given a list of coordinate pairs representing the start and end points of lines, two lines can be combined into a single line if one of the endpoints of one line matches an endpoint of another line. If more than two lines meet at a point, no combination occurs at that point. The input file contains one line per line segment, with each line containing four floating-point numbers separated by spaces, representing the coordinates \(X1\), \(Y1\), \(X2\), and \(Y2\).

## Thoughts

As this task is rather straightforward, I prioritized a lightweight implementation without unnecessary complications from design patterns that might add variability or advanced parsing technologies. However, considerations of specific patterns and arguments are communicated through comments.

## Software Stack

As the interviewer suggested a tendency towards adapting frontend technologies and libraries as a backend developer, I would brand this project as a React-driven. Thus, a lightweight Java web framework as the backend (for a single GET request), combined with ReactJS, should suit the needs.
